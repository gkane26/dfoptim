Derivative-Free optimization algorithms. These algorithms do not require gradient information.  
More importantly, they can be used to solve non-smooth optimization problems. 
These algorithms were translated from the Matlab code of Prof. C.T. Kelley, given in his book "Iterative methods for optimization".

However, there are some non-trivial modifications of the algorithm.

Currently, the Nelder-Mead and Hooke-Jeeves algorithms is implemented.  In future, more derivative-free algorithms may be added.
